        <p>
          There are several levels in this game and all levels except 1 can be
          played by two people and that too on one device.<br />

          At that 2 player level., player blue and player red both are separated
          by a white line and also there is a striker on the center of the
          playing area <br />

          And both players have a different mathematical question. Those who
          solve that question quickly, Can win the game. when you answer the
          questions the striker moves to the opponent’s court , if the player
          red answers quickly the striker moves to blues court and if it touches
          to the blue line the red will win in that game. Likewise for player
          blue. And also there is a timer in this game when the time Hits 0 then
          it evaluates in which court has the most part of the striker is. if
          the most part of the striker is in reds court then blue win the game.
          Likewise for player red. <br />

          And you can also play alone. There is a solo level. Which increase
          your calculating speed and you can score a great Highscore that no one
          can beat.
